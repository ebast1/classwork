Data is stored in tables (2-dimensional - like a Spreadsheet)
Tables has a set of related rows 
Row is collection of related columns
Column - a single value
Tables may be related to other tables (parent / dependent)
Parent tables have primary keys
Dependent tables have foreign keys

Referential Integrity (RI) - DBMS Enforcement of the Parent-Dependent relationship                                                                           ie. DBMS Ensure that every foreign key value has a matching primary key

Relational Tables may have multiple types of keys (identifiers):

 	Primary Key  - 	Column is part of the unique identifier for a row in the table
                			UNIQUE and NOT NULL are implied
						when specified for a table it makes the table a potential parent table in an RI relationship 						a table is not a parent until a foreign key matches to it (it has a dependent)

    Foreign Key  - 	Column is part of a foreign key for the table.  
             	   			Value must have a matching value in the primary key of the parent table
                			Establishes the parent-dependent relationshipspecified for a table
						makes the table a dependent in an RI relationship

	UNIQUE       - 	Column value must be unique with the table 

Referential Intergrity (Parent/Dependent relationship) limits what INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE can do
      						RI adds constraints to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

 INSERT - 	parent table - always allowed

          		dependent table - allowed only if the foreign already has a matching primary key in the parent
          		
				we can always INSERT a row to a parent table
          		
				we can only INSERT a row into a dependent table if it's Foreign Key(s) matches existing 
						Primary Key value(s) in it's parent

				Always populate parent table(s) before their associsted dependent tables


 UPDATE - parent table -	a Primary Key value  cannot be updated if it has existing dependents
							 		(at least one Foreign Key matches it) UNLESS...
									 the update CASCADE option is specified in the Foreign Key clause 															when the dependent relationship is defined
                         						which means if the Primary Key value changes 
											all matching Foreign Key values will also change

          		dependent - 	a Foreign Key may only be changed to an existing Primary Key value


 DELETE - parent - 	a parent row cannot be deleted if it's Primary Key has matching Foreign Keys
                  				UNLESS the DELETE SET NULL option is specified specified in the Foreign Key
							clause when the dependent relationship is defined
                        				which means all Foreign Keys matching the Primary will be set to NULL
                          			the null value in the Foreign Key must be changed to match an existing Primary Key
                                       before you can do anything with the dependent table 
                          
							for DELETE SET NULL to be valid, the Foreign Key cannot be defined as UNIQUE 
								or NOT NULLit also cannot be part of the Primary Key of the dependent table
                   					OR the DELETE CASCADE option is specified for the parent table
                          			which means a delete of a parent rows also deletes all dependent rows (DANGEROUS!)
  TLDR: If tables have Primary Keys and Foreign Keys you may not be able to do certain INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
