                <p class="bloggingSection">
                Every project begins with a question. What problem am I really trying to solve? Who is this for? Why does it matter? Curiosity fuels everything I do.
                I don't just want to know what a client or user needs—I want to understand it well enough to build something that anticipates what they didn’t know they needed.

            <p class="bloggingHeader">Process Over Perfection</p>
                <p class="bloggingSection">
                I've learned that iteration beats hesitation. Early in my journey, I used to overthink every step before committing to a direction.
                Now, I believe in putting something into the world—even if it's rough—and shaping it through feedback and reflection.
                Progress is built in layers, and I embrace every version along the way.

            <p class="bloggingHeader">Creating with Care</p>
                <p class="bloggingSection">
                    Whether it's a visual detail or a small interaction, the little things matter.
                    I try to build with care, because thoughtful design (and development) often reveals itself in the moments that are easy to overlook.
                    At the end of the day, if something I make makes someone pause—even briefly—to appreciate the experience, I consider that a win.

                <p class="bloggingSection">
                    Lately, I've been focused on sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, C#, and SwiftUI.
                    I'm especially interested in how more streamlined UX can lead to more inclusive, efficient, or meaningful experiences.

                <p class="bloggingSection">
                    Outside of structured work, I've been researching Design principles and how they connect to the work I already do and where it might take me next.
                    I don't believe learning ever really stops, and this space is where I let curiosity lead.

            <p class="bloggingHeader">Where's my Hometown?</p>
                <p class="bloggingSection">
                    I grew up between Dearborn and Grosse Ile, which are two totally different vibes, but both feel like home in their own way.
                    Dearborn is where I got a sense of how much is always going on—different people, ideas, cultures, food spots, history, all packed into one place.
                    It's busy, grounded, and always kind of pushing forward. I think being around that made me curious early on.
                    It's probably where I picked up my love for figuring things out and making stuff that actually matters to people.
                    Grosse Ile is slower, quieter—it's literally an island.
                    That's where I spent time just wandering around, playing games, sketching ideas, or doing nothing and somehow still learning from it.
                    It's where I learned to enjoy the process and not just chase the finish line.
